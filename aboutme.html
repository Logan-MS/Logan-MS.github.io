          I have an associate's degree in Web Design and Development from
          Harrisburg Area Community College, and I've also completed several
          certifications from Linkedin Learning courses. Additionally, I
          received a certificate in UX design from Google through Coursera and
          am currently working on a certificate in Brand Identity from the
          London Business School on Coursera. You can view all of these
          certificates on my &nbsp;

          To reach me, you can email me at lsmileydesign82@outlook.com or on

          I possess four years of experience working with HTML, CSS, and
          Photoshop, in addition to my education and certifications. I also have
          a fundamental understanding of working with WordPress.com, as well as
          Adobe Applications from their Creative Cloud suite, such as Adobe
          Illustrator, Premiere Pro, Audition, XD, Dreamweaver, Lightroom, After
          Effects, and Photoshop.
        </p>

        <p class="copy">
          <br />
          I have developed and honed various soft skills, including effective
          communication in person, over the phone, and in digital meetings. Over
          the years, I have gained valuable experience in problem-solving, from
          resolving issues with code to addressing miscommunications with
          clients and handling unforeseen incidents on the job. Additionally, I
          am an attentive listener who welcomes constructive feedback.
        </p>

        <p class="copy">
          <br />Aside from my education and professional experiences, I am fond
          of video games because they provide immersive experiences and
          thought-provoking narratives. I enjoy repairing and assembling
          projects as well as reading books. My favorite novel is Notes from the
          Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky. I have a keen interest in the
          retrofuturism art movement and appreciate its creations, such as the
          Fallout game series. I have extensively studied history, and I enjoy
          discussing how we can learn from it to make the future better and help
          others.
